I've implemented a real-time crypto analytics dashboard using the CoinGecko API. Key features:

1. Real market data:
<ul>
Top cryptocurrencies by market cap
Global market statistics
7-day price history for Bitcoin
24-hour price changes
</ul>  
2. Auto-updating:
<ul>
Data refreshes every minute
Last updated timestamp
Smooth transitions between updates
</ul> 
3. Comprehensive views:
<ul>
Market overview cards
Price chart
Top coins list with key metrics
</ul> 
4. Error handling:
<ul>
Graceful fallbacks for API failures
Loading states
Type-safe data handling
</ul>
