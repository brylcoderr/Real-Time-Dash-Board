I've created a beautiful and functional real-time analytics dashboard with the following features:

Real-time data simulation (updates every 5 seconds)
Key metrics cards with trend indicators
Interactive line charts for page views and session duration
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
Clean, modern UI with smooth animations
Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
The dashboard includes:

Active users count
Total page views
Average session duration
Bounce rate
Real-time page views chart
Session duration chart
The data is simulated but the structure is ready to be connected to a real ClickHouse backend. Just replace the useAnalytics hook implementation with actual API calls when you have the backend ready.
