I've created a beautiful and functional real-time analytics dashboard with the following features:

Real-time data simulation (updates every 5 seconds)
Key metrics cards with trend indicators
Interactive line charts for page views and session duration
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
Clean, modern UI with smooth animations
Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

The dashboard includes:

Active users count<br>
Total page views<br>
Average session duration<br>
Bounce rate<br>
Real-time page views chart<br>
Session duration chart<br>
The data is simulated but the structure is ready to be connected to a real ClickHouse backend. Just replace the useAnalytics hook implementation with actual API calls when you have the backend ready.
